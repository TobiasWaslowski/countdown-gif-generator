# The Countdown-GIF Generator

Have you ever done a presentation where you had some sort of countdown running?
Maybe you were giving your listeners two minutes to reflect on something or do some task?
Chances are, if you have, you've had to use external software or embed a YouTube video in your presentation.
With this tool, you can easily create a GIF that you can directly embed in your presentation.
